- [done] add foreign key to some tags for messages, users, and conversations (string is fine)
- handle incorrects inputs (like missing foreign keys, or no user / conversation / message objects).
- handle incorrect payloads (payload should work with botpress, otherwise, it should be marked as "custom")
-- UPDATE THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS WE SEND A TEXT PAYLOAD OF STRING LENGTH > 0 
-- EVERYTHING ELSE CAN BE MODIFIED
-- basically, tell the user what he / she should do from the api without docs.
- [done] remove all unnecessary code
- [done] convert the inbound webhook to an api with responses.
- require a valid PAT

FUN Maybe for the future
- allow different integrations to send messages to conversations of this integration.
-- idea : maybe use something like https://www.gomomento.com/
